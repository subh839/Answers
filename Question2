Redux middleware function provides a medium to interact with dispatched action before they reach the reducer.
Customized middleware functions can be created by writing high order functions (a function that returns another function)and
which wraps around some logic. Multiple middlewares can be combined together to add new functionality,
and each middleware requires no knowledge of what came before and after.


First need to import the applyMiddleware function from Redux like this:

import { applyMiddleware } from "redux";


Middleware helps with logging, error reporting, making asynchronous requests, and a whole lot more.
